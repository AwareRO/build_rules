**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**hic sunt dracones**

---

This project is intended to be used as an exploration of
build systems. It is expected that the interfaces will
change in the future. If for some reason you chose to
depend on this project, email me about it at busui.matei1994@gmail.com
so I can notify you when I introduce breaking changes.


Run `make all-tests` if you're worried about backwards compatibility
